# Todo Mundo Kafé.
Scandinavian countries have the highest consumption per capta of coffee in the world and Sweden occupies the second position on the list, making the coffee bussiness a great market to invest on.
This project consists in a website for a coffee shop for traveler who visit or stay in Stockholm, and somehow want to get involved with locals and other tourists. The Todo Mundo Kafé is a place where people can come and have a coffe meal and surf the net, but also its a place that differs from other coffee houses for offering activities that aim to connect people beyond the wifi, like karaoke, live music and open mic events.
Our project's goal is to atract visitors and stimulate them not only to feel home but also to share their experiences with others.

## UX
We target on tourists who are visiting Stockholm, as well as locals who want to interact with them.
People who would like to eat or drink from an international menu and somehow feel like if they are at their local caffé at their hometown and locals who want to enjoy traditional coffee and food from other countries.
